SnowSpeedPlugin
===============
im making this plugin for the owner of a server both as a favor and as an impromptu test for my developer rank.
i have never made a plugin before and i am using software ive never heard of so i wont be much surprised if this fails horribly. 
im using eclipse to create and compile my code and im using (for the most part) a simple craftbukkit test server to run the plugin on to make sure it works. 
i had help from Europia79 and a bunch of internet resources. but for the most part i did all the coding, compiling, testing, and crying-in-dispair.
